# JSON

The JavaScript objects notation (JSON) is widely used to interchange
data. Running pygount with `--format`
"json" is a simple way to provide the results of an analysis for
further processing.

## General format

The general structure of the resulting JSON is:

```JavaScript
{
  "formatVersion": "1.1.0",
  "pygountVersion": "1.8.0",
  "files": [...],
  "languages": [...],
  "runtime": {...},
  "summary": {...}
}
```

The naming of the entries deliberately uses camel case to conform to the
[JSLint](https://www.jslint.com/) guidelines.

Both `formatVersion` and `pygountVersion` use [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/). For more information about how this
JSON evolved, see `JSON format history`.

### Files

With `files` you can access a list of files analyzed, for example:

```JavaScript
{
  "codeCount": 171,
  "documentationCount": 28,
  "emptyCount": 56,
  "group": "pygount",
  "isCountable": true,
  "language": "Python",
  "lineCount": 266,
  "path": "/tmp/pygount/pygount/write.py",
  "state": "analyzed",
  "stateInfo": null,
  "sourceCount": 182
}
```

The `*Count` fields have the following meaning:

- `codeCount`: The number of lines that contains code, excluding
  :ref:?\`Pure string lines\`
- `documentationCount`: The number of lines containing comments
- `emptyCount`: The number of empty lines, which includes
  "`No operations`" lines
- `lineCount`: Basically the number of lines shown in your editor
  respectively computed by shell commands like `wc -l`,
- `sourceCount`: The source lines of code, similar to the traditional
  SLOC
- `stringCount`: The number of `Pure string lines`

Here, `sourceCount` is the number of source lines of code (SLOC),
`documentationCount` the number of lines containing comments and

The `state` can have one of the following values:

- analyzed: successfully analyzed
- binary: the file is a `binary file <binary>`
- duplicate: the file is a `duplicate <duplicates>` of another
- empty: the file is empty (file size = 0)
- error: the source could not be parsed; in this case, `stateInfo`
  contains a message with more details
- generated: the file has been generated as specified with
  `--generated`
- unknown: pygments does not offer any lexer to analyze the file

### Languages

In `languages` the summary for each language is available, for example:

```JavaScript
{
  "documentationCount": 429,
  "documentationPercentage": 11.776008783969257,
  "codeCount": 2332,
  "codePercentage": 64.01317595388416,
  "emptyCount": 706,
  "emptyPercentage": 19.3796321712874,
  "fileCount": 20,
  "filePercentage": 48.78048780487805,
  "isPseudoLanguage": false,
  "language": "Python",
  "sourceCount": 2508,
  "sourcePercentage": 68.84435904474334,
  "stringCount": 176,
  "stringPercentage": 4.831183090859182
}
```

### Summary

In `summary` the total counts across the whole project can be accessed,
for example:

```JavaScript
"summary": {
  "totalCodeCount": 4366,
  "totalCodePercentage": 68.38972431077694,
  "totalDocumentationCount": 463,
  "totalDocumentationPercentage": 7.25250626566416,
  "totalEmptyCount": 1275,
  "totalEmptyPercentage": 19.971804511278197,
  "totalFileCount": 41,
  "totalSourceCount": 4646,
  "totalSourcePercentage": 72.77568922305764,
  "totalStringCount": 280,
  "totalStringPercentage": 4.385964912280702
}
```

### Runtime

The `runtime` entry collects general information about how well pygount
performed in collecting the information, for example:

```JavaScript
"runtime": {
  "durationInSeconds": 0.6333059999999999,
  "filesPerSecond": 64.73963613166464,
  "finishedAt": "2024-05-13T16:14:31.977070+00:00",
  "linesPerSecond": 10080.435050354807,
  "startedAt": "2024-05-13T16:14:31.343764+00:00"
}
```

## Pretty printing

Because the output is concise and consequently mostly illegible for a
human reader, you might want to pipe it through a pretty printer. As you
already have python installed, the easiest way is:

```sh
pygount --format json | python -m json.tool
```

Another alternativ would be [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

```sh
pygount --format json | jq .
```

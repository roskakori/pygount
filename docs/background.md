# Background

## How pygount counts code

Pygount primarily counts the physical lines of source code. It begins by using lexers from Pygments, if available. If Pygments doesn't have a suitable lexer, pygount employs its own internal lexers to differentiate between code and comments. These include:

- Minimalist lexers for m4, VBScript, and WebFOCUS, capable of distinguishing between comments and code.
- The Java lexer repurposed for OMG IDL.

Additionally, plain text is treated with a separate lexer that considers all lines as comments.

Lines consisting solely of comment tokens or whitespace are counted as comments.

Lines with only whitespace are ignored.

All other content is considered code.

## White characters

A line containing only "white characters" is also ignored because they do not contribute to code complexity in any meaningful way. Currently, white characters are:

```
(),:;[]{}
```

Because of that, pygount tends to report about 5 to 15 percent fewer SLOC for C-like languages than other similar tools.

## No operations

For some languages, "no operations" are detected and treated as white space. For example, Python's `pass` or Transact-SQL's `begin` and `end`.

As example, consider this Python code:

```python
class SomeError(Exception):
    """
    Some error caused by some issue.
    """
    pass
```

This counts as 1 line of code and 3 lines of comments. The line with `pass` is considered a "no operation" and thus not taken into account.

## Pure string lines

Many programming languages support the concept of strings, which typically often contain text to be shown to the end user or simple constant values. Similar to white character and "no operations" in most cases, they do not add much to the complexity of the code. Notable exceptions are strings containing code for domain-specific languages, templates, or SQL statements.

Pygount currently takes an opinionated approach on how to count pure string lines depending on the output format:

- With `--format=summary`, pure string lines are ignored similar to empty lines
- With `--format` set to `sloccount` or `cloc-xml` string lines are counted as code, resulting in somewhat similar counts as the original tools.
- With `format=json` all variants are available as attributes and you can choose which one you prefer.

In hindsight, this is an inconsistency that might warrant a cleanup. See issue [#122](https://github.com/roskakori/pygount/issues/122) for a discussion and issue [#152](https://github.com/roskakori/pygount/issues/152) for a plan on how to clean this up.

## Binary files

When a file is considered to be binary when all the following
conditions match:

1. The file does not start with a BOM for UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 (which indicates text files).
2. The initial 8192 bytes contain at least one 0 byte.

In this case, pygount assigns it the pseudo language `__binary__` and performs no further analysis.

## Comparison with other tools

Pygount can analyze more languages than other common tools such as
sloccount or cloc because it builds on `pygments`, which provides lexers for hundreds of languages. This also makes enables supporting another language: [Write your own
lexer](http://pygments.org/docs/lexerdevelopment/).

For certain corner cases, pygount gives more accurate results because it actually lexes the code unlike other tools that mostly look for comment markers and can get confused when they show up inside strings. In practice, though, this should not make much of a difference.

Pygount is slower than most other tools. Partially, this is due to actually lexing instead of just scanning the code. Partially, because other tools can use statically compiled languages such as Java or C, which are generally faster than dynamic languages. For many applications though, pygount should be "fast enough", especially when running as an asynchronous step during a continuous integration build.

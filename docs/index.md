# Pygount

Pygount is a command line tool to scan folders for source code files and count the number of source code lines in it. It is similar to tools like [sloccount](http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/) and [cloc](http://cloc.sourceforge.net/) but uses the [pygments](http://pygments.org/) package to parse the source code and consequently can analyze any [programming language supported by pygments](http://pygments.org/languages/).

The name is a combination of "pygments" and "count".
